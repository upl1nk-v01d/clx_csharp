    What is a bug? 
@snapend

@snap[midpoint span-80 text-white fragment] 
    Definition: A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The process of fixing bugs is termed debugging and often uses formal techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs.]

@snap[north] The "First bug" @snapend

Note:

Famously the very first instance of a computer bug was recorded at 3:45 pm (15:45) on the 9th of September 1947. This "bug" was an actual real-life, well ex-moth, that was extracted from the number 70 relay, Panel F, of the Harvard Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator.
